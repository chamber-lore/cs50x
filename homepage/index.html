                Welcome to my homepage!
            </h1>
            <p>My name is Lorenzo Chamberlin. For Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course, I've been tasked with making a basic homepage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hence,
                 <span class="hovertext" title="And all the others contained therewith...">this page</span>,
                  which leaves a lot to be desired. Nevertheless! As Thomas Paine said: </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.</p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer" style="display: inline;"><cite title="Source Title">The Crisis</cite></footer>

            <p>Drawing upon such wisdom of my forebears, I present this humble website. In its entirety:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="codex.html">The Codex</a>,
                     which is essentially a bit of a look into my (current) mind in list form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="pix.html">Pix</a>,
                     which was essentially a stretch to see if I could end all of my pages in "ix", which is totally a reference to *NIX and not just the word "index."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="affix.html">Affix</a>,
                     which will be essentially a surprise ;)
                </li>
            </ol>
