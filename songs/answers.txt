I would characterize the aura of the hypothetical person represented by the table as pretty energized across the board, but with a very slight negative tilt--always moving, but only to provide a backdrop for thought.
By their nature, averages fail to account for the extrema. Really, these are the top 100 songs, and in them are very sad and slow and very happy and quick songs, along with everything in between. You could take the median as a start. But more specifically, the aura calculation fails to properly correlate all of the data. Even just what's selected for (danceability, enrgy, and valence) tend to appear in certain configurations more or less than they would by chance, but ignoring tempo and particularly speechiness makes that difficult to see.
